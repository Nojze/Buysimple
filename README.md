The concept of this work was to create an online store where the design of the website is suitable for all users, mainly focusing on the distribution of information, user experience, and the functionality of the website. 

## What to know
This project is built on mainly HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP. Or though my knowledge of PHP and JavaScript are kinda scrappy, I tried to used them to their fullest. The bootstrap framework was also used in order to design the responsiveness.

## Built With

* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - The source code editor for every language used
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - Framework for the responsive design
* [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/) - FTP application I used for the server and files management
